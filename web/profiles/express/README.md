# Express Installation Profile

The Express installation profile is developed and maintained by the University of Colorado Boulder where it is provided at no charge for college/school, academic and administrative department, and research group, lab and institute websites through the [Web Express service](http://www.colorado.edu/webcentral/).

This is a customized installation profile of the [Drupal content management system](https://www.drupal.org/).  We maintain this publicly largely for other similar organization to reference. We do not support this code beyond working with developers employed by other schools in the University of Colorado system or developers working with a vendor hired by an organization affiliated with the University of Colorado system.

## Open Source Supporters

The Express profile takes advantage of several service providers that have open source licenses we use to develop the profile.
